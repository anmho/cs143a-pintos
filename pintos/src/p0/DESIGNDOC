			     Kernel Monitor
			     ==============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
I did not use

---- ALGORITHMS ----
>> C2: Explain how you read and write to the console for the kernel monitor.
I used input_getc from pintos stdlib to get input character by character and write to the buffer until a newline is reached.

>> C3: Any additional enhancement you implement?
I added character print to stdout so the input feels responsive.
